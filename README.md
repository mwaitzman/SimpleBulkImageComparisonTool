# SimpleBulkImageComparisonTool
 a tool to create a map between images in a specified folder and their closest match in another folder, using deepai's image comparison api to do so under the hood.

To use the program, navigate to this repo's folder and do `python App.py <path to first folder> <path to second folder> <API key`.
 future goals:
 
  make requests asynchronous, or at the very least, multithreaded.
  
  add support for nested folders
  
  add all the other file types that deepAI supports
  
  add command line switches to modify functionality
